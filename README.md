🎮 Angry Birds Replica with Unique Power-Ups
This project is a simple yet exciting replication of the Angry Birds game, built with my own creative twist! Along with the classic slingshot mechanics, I’ve introduced two unique power-ups that add a fresh challenge to the gameplay:

🚀 Zero Gravity Bird
A special bird that defies gravity! Instead of falling, it floats freely after being launched, allowing for strategic mid-air adjustments to hit tricky targets.

🏀 Bouncy Bird
This bird is all about momentum and ricochets! Upon impact, it bounces off surfaces instead of stopping, making it perfect for taking out multiple structures with a single shot.
